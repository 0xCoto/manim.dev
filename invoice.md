To get started with invoicing,

1. Get yourself an invoice template. You can <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FKarsRJNb0ZbmDSZnf-6xt6U6yFxU-_lvwpGFjFQgwk/edit?usp=sharing">click here</a> for one on Google Docs. Make a copy of it in your own account.
2. Fill in your name, business address and email address.
3. Fill in your client's name, business address and email address.
4. Set your invoice number. If this is your first one, start from 00001. Increment it by one for every new invoice you create. Each invoice you send has to have a unique invoice number in that year, so you can reset the counter back to 00001 when a new year begins.
5. Set the invoice date as today, i.e. the date you are creating that invoice.
6. Decide on the latest day you would like to receive the payment. Freelancers usually work [net 15 or net 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_D), meaning that they demand the sum to be paid at most 15 or 30 days after the date of the invoice. E.g. if your invoice date is 01.01.2022 and you prefer net 15, set the **Invoice Due Date** to 16.01.2022.
7. Enter a description of the service you have provided. For Manim, you could say "Software development and consultancy for mathematical animations".
8. If you bill your client per unit time of your work, say hourly, then:
    - Note it at the end of the description as **", hourly-rated"**.
    - Set **Quantity** to the amount of hours you worked.
    - Set **Price** to your hourly rate.
9. If you have to pay VAT in your country, set **Tax** as your VAT percentage. If you are working with clients abroad, this is sometimes not required, so you can set it to 0%.
10. Calculate the final amount as `amount = (1 + vat_percentage) * quantity * price`. For example, if your hourly rate is 20 USD/hour, you have worked for 5 hours and the VAT percentage is 20%, you should receive `1.20 * 5 * 20 = 120 USD`.
11. Sum up the amounts of all the items, and write it as the total amount on bottom right.
12. Add your preferred way of payment under the **Notes** section, e.g. your local bank account, PayPal link, etc. Make sure ask your client whether they are OK with paying you in a certain way before you send them the invoice.
13. When you are sure that you have entered all the details correctly, export a PDF. Do not share a Google Doc link, because these sort of documents need to be immutable once you send it to the client.

Congratulations! You have created your first invoice. Send it to your client to get paid, and don't forget to save the PDF locally for your own records.
