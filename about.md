## About Manim

Manim is an community maintained Python library for creating mathematical animations. It was created in 2015 by Grant Sanderson, a.k.a. 3blue1brown, as a personal project to produce his own videos. As his channel gained popularity, many grew to like the style of his animations and wanted to use Manim for their own projects. However, as Manim was only intended for personal use, it was very difficult for other users to install and use it.

Manim has since been adopted by a group of developers, who forked it mid-2020 into what is now known as the [community edition](https://manim.community).
