## For developers

### Learning Manim

TBD

### How to bill your work

If you are going to work as a contractor, there are two ways you can bill your clients:

1. **Flat fee:** You charge a fixed sum for each project, which includes minor changes you might need to apply after your client's feedback.
2. **Hourly rate:** You charge per hour spent working on the project.

The choice between (1) and (2) is a matter of who is going to take on the risk that the project takes longer than expected:

- If you choose a flat fee, <u>you</u> (i.e. the developer) might have to work more hours for the same pay.
- If you choose an hourly rate, the <u>client</u> might have to pay for more hours than your initial estimate and also receive the final product much later.

The most important thing to note is:

<div class="alert" markdown="0">Manim is in <u>alpha</u> stage, so you might encounter <u>tricky bugs</u> and end up spending more hours than you expect on a project.</div>

In <u>small projects</u>, in order to prevent bad service to the client, developers tend to take on the risk themselves and <u>charge a flat fee</u>. You can also negotiate extra payment, if the client demands a major change when you are close to finishing the project. Here is an example offer:

> The whole animation will cost you 100 USD.
>
> - 40 USD for the first scene.
> - 60 USD for the second scene, because I will need to write new classes.
>
> Minor changes are included in the price. If you don't like the end result and will want me to do a considerable rework, I will have to charge you extra (in addition to the 100 USD).

In <u>large projects</u> with longer-term employment, you might be better off charging hourly (or daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

### Invoicing clients

<div class="alert" markdown="0"><u>Invoice</u> your clients <u>each and every time</u> you request a payment from them.</div>

This has a couple of advantages:

- It shows professionality, and makes your client take you more seriously.
- It helps you to keep track of your income.
- Most importantly, it helps your client to keep track of their expenses, which they might deduct from their taxes.

## For clients

### Do you need Manim?

Before hiring a developer, make sure that Manim is the right tool for what you are trying to produce:

<div class="alert" markdown="0">Manim is most suited for cases where you can animate something mathematical more efficiently by <u>writing a program</u>, instead of doing it manually by clicking around.</div>

We created a chart that can help you to decide:

### Reaching out to a developer

TBD

### Prepare a storyboard

A <u>storyboard</u> is a collection of drawings and text that describe how the animation should play out. Before you let the developer start working on your animation, the **most important thing** you have to do is:

<div class="alert" markdown="0">Prepare a <u>detailed storyboard</u> for the developer.</div>

**Planning** is the most essential step in creating an animation. The developer's task is to convert already planned out scenes to code. If the scenes are not planned out in enough detail, the developer is forced to improvise. And that often leads the developer to produce results that are different than what you expect.

To prevent the developer from having to redo your scenes and **charging you extra**, you should add enough details to your storyboard as to leave as less ambiguity as possible. A good rule of thumb:

<div class="alert" markdown="0"><u>One minute</u> that you spend adding details to your storyboard saves the developer <u>one hour</u> of work spent on rewriting code.</div>
