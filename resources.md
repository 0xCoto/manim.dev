## Resources for developers

### How to bill your work

TBD

### Invoicing clients

> ⚠️ **Invoice** your clients **each and every time** you request a payment from them.

This has a couple of advantages:

- It shows professionality, and makes your client take you more seriously.
- It helps you to keep track of your income.
- Most importantly, it helps your client to keep track of their expenses, which they might deduct from their taxes.

### Do you need Manim?

TBD

<!-- Manim is most suited for cases where you can animate something more **efficiently by writing a program for it**, instead of doing it manually.

Grant Sanderson [gives the following advice](https://youtu.be/ruUfqQPDdDs?t=138):

> Step one is, make sure that what you're animating should be done so, programmatically—because a lot of things maybe shouldn't. If you're just making a quick graph of something—if it's a graphical intuition that maybe has a little motion to it—use [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/), [Grapher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapher), [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/), [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), certain things that are really oriented around graphs.
>
> The original thought I had in making Manim was that there are so many different ways of representing functions—other than graphs—in particular things like transformations. For example, use movement over time to communicate relationships between inputs and outputs instead of x and y directions, or vector fields, or things like that.
>
> I wanted something that was flexible enough that you didn't feel constrained into a graphical environment—by graphical I mean graphs with x and y coordinates. But also make sure that you're taking advantage of the fact that it's programmatic. You have loops, conditionals, abstraction. If any of those are well fit for what you want to teach, to have
>
> - a scene type that you tweak a little bit based on parameters,
> - conditionals so that things can go one way or another,
> - loops so that you can create things of arbitrarily increasing complexity,
>
> that's the stuff that's meant to be animated programmatically. **If it's just writing some text on the screen or shifting around objects or something like that, you should probably just use [Keynote](https://www.apple.com/keynote)—it will be a lot simpler.**
>
> Try to find a workflow that distills down that which should be programmatic into Manim, and that which doesn't need to be
> into other domains. -->

### Reach out to a developer

TBD

### Prepare a storyboard

Before you let the developer start working on your animation, the **most important thing** you have to do is...

> ⚠️ **Prepare a good and detailed storyboard** for the developer. ⚠️

> ⚠️ **Prepare a good and detailed storyboard** for the developer. ⚠️

We repeat it three times, because **planning** is the most essential step in creating an animation. The developer's task is to convert already planned out scenes to code. If the scenes are not planned out in enough detail, the developer is forced to improvise. And that often leads the developer to produce results that are different than what you expect.

To prevent the developer from having to redo your scenes and **charging you extra**, you should add enough details to your storyboard as to leave as less ambiguity as possible. A good rule of thumb is,

> ⚠️ <u>One minute</u> that you spend adding details to your storyboard saves the developer <u>one hour</u> of work spent on rewriting code.
